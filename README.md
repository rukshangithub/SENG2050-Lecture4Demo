# SENG2050-Lecture4Demo

This repository is used for SENG2050 Lecture 4 Demo

Note that as discussed in the lecture, this demo has a lot of unpolished code. For example, 
* No security considerations - hardcoding username/password for databases, not hashing passwords in database, not using a secure protocol for client-server communication
* Not using connection pools for database connections, etc.
These considerations will be looked at in future lectures/sprints

However, this code does show the use of MVC and DAO patterns for login process which can help with your assignment
